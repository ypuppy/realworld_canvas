RealWorld Canvas: Immersive Marketing Solution
Our project, RealWorld Canvas, addresses the challenges of Category 2: Immersive Marketing by offering users a seamless and engaging platform for well-integrated, captivating marketing experiences.

User Interface Overview
The user interface of RealWorld Canvas is divided into two main sections:
1.	Google Maps Photorealistic 3D Maps (Left Panel): This section incorporates all standard functionalities provided by Google Maps, such as search, zoom, tilt adjustment, rotation, and translation.
2.	Real Street View (Right Panel): This panel displays a street-level perspective corresponding to the position of the “yellow person” on the 3D map. 
The integration of these two panels provides users with both a comprehensive overview of the location and a detailed, ground-level view.

Additional User Interface features include:
1.	Street View Maximization: A button located in the top-right corner allows users to expand the street view, offering an enlarged and focused display of street-level details.
2.	Toggle Advertisement Display: The “Toggle Info Window” button enables users to control whether advertisements are displayed, ensuring a customizable experience.

Function Description 
1.	Accurate Navigation & Precise Route Planning: Users can search for destinations on the 3D map and initiate navigation. By combining an overview from the 3D Maps with the detailed street view, users receive both comprehensive directional guidance and a clear sense of distance and orientation.
2.	Dynamic Position Switching: With a simple mouse click, users can reposition the “yellow person” on the 3D map. The street view on the right panel updates in real-time to reflect this change, allowing users to better explore and understand the area surrounding their destination.
3.	Integrated Advertising: Superlinks & Reality Views: This feature is the core highlight of RealWorld Canvas, providing unique advertising opportunities:
a)	Location-Based Advertising: Businesses can purchase advertising slots for specific areas. For instance, a store can reserve a 3km-radius advertisement zone centered on its location. When users navigate within this radius, the store’s advertisement automatically appears in the advertisement info window on the right panel.
b)	Visual Embedding: Businesses can opt to display their logos or icons directly within the street view, creating a more engaging and direct advertising experience that captures users’ attention.

By combining advanced navigation, dynamic position switching, and immersive advertising, RealWorld Canvas offers an innovative platform that bridges the gap between marketing and interactive user experiences.
